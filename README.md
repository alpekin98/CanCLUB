Web Development Term Project

To make PHP files work, you need to install AppServ program.
After the installation completed, you need to put the "project" file
into the "www" file located in "AppServ" file.

After all, you must enter localhost:"portyouselected"/phpMyAdmin from a 
web browser and login. Then you must import the SQL file.
Now everything is ready to work.
